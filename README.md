# Description

I don't like dmenu's philosophy so I developed mrul (Most Recently Used Launcher).

# Usage

Build or update executable database:

```
mrul update
```

Configure a key binding to invoke `mrul` command in your favourite window manager.

# Dependence

- c++11 capable compiler
- libxcb-1.9.1
- xcb-util-keysyms-0.3.9

# TODO

- Cleanup code.
- Support Xft.
