I don't like dmenu's philosophy so I developed MruLauncher.
Furthermore, MruLauncher has better support for TAB completion.

Usage:
1.First time:
mrulanucher update
2.Next time:
mrulanucher

Dependence (FreeBSD):
c++11 compiler
libxcb-1.9.1
xcb-util-keysyms-0.3.9

TODO:
1.Support command argument. (so we can run 'killall xxx')
2.Support Xft. (TTF fonts are always nice)
3.Multi-screen. (if I have another screen I will)
